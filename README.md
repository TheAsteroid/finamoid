# Finamoid - Bank statement management
Finamoid is a personal finance manager for categorizing and aggregating bank statements, aimed at household bank accounts.

## Idea
Analyzing bank statements can be a tedious task. This application aims to provide better insight into your finances by categorizing and aggregating your payment transactions. These are some questions this application aims to answer:
* How much did I spend on groceries last month?
* How much do I spend on fixed costs every month, and how fixed are these costs really?
* How much did I put into my savings account the last half year?
* In which categories am I overspending?

## Features
âœ… Import bank statements (mutations) from several formats. Currently ASN Bank CSV is implemented.

âœ… Import categories from CSV to kickstart the application while not having a UI to manage categories.

âœ… Categorize mutations based on filters (partial, exact, bank account number).

âœ… Aggregate categorized mutations into sum by time (e.g. spendings per category per month).

âœ… Interactive CLI to do all above steps while the UI is still under construction.

âœ… 100% offline, with the option to store data encrypted (untested).
